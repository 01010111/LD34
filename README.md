## UPSQUID ##

Upsquid was made for Ludum Dare 34 - the themes were Two Button Controls and/or Growing.
I chose to work with Two Button Controls, so you control the squid in three ways -
* Press Left or Right to change the heading of Upsquid (Counter-clockwise or Clockwise respectively).
* Release Left or Right to thrust in the direction Upsquid is facing.
* Press Left and Right together once the combo meter is full to go into Over-Boost

_In the post-compo version, you can also press up to enter the menu, as well as up and down while in the menu._

The goal of Upsquid is two-fold:
* Reach the highest point you can
* Eat as many creatures in rapid succession as possible to build a high combo
